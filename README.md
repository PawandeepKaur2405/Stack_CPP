üë∂üèªFreshers can also see :  
1. **Array implementation** of stack [here](https://github.com/PawandeepKaur2405/Stack_CPP/blob/main/stack.cpp) 
2. **Linked List implementation** of stack [here](https://github.com/PawandeepKaur2405/Stack_CPP/blob/main/stackusinglinkedlist.cpp)  

## 1. Infix to postfix

### Infix expression : 
Expression in which operator is in between the operands.  
Eg. a+b-c

### Postfix expression : 
Expression in which operator is after the operands.  
Eg. abc-+

This question converts an infix expression to postfix expression using stacks. 

## 2. Infix to prefix

### Prefix expression :  
Expression in which operator is before the operands.  
Eg. +-abc

This question converts an infix expression to prefix expression using stacks.   
**[Note: Compiler takes less time to evaluate postfix or prefix expression than infix expression as it need not maintain priority of operators.]**

## 3. Postfix Evaluation  

The Question evaluates a postfix expression using stack

## 4. Prefix Evaluation

The Question evaluated a prefix expression using stack.

## 5. Bracket Balance  

The question deals with a string of brackets.  
{[()]} : Balanced  
{([)]} : Unbalanced  

It's done using stack data structure in this question  

## 6. Reverse Sentence  

The question reverses a sentence using stack.
Input : We all will achieve together
Output : together achieve will all We  

## 7. Reverse Stack  

The question reverses stack without using any other data structure.
